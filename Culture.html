                        <p>Cape Town's rich history dates back more than 12 000 years with early human presence found in Peers Cave.
                        During 1652 Jan van Riebeeck established Dutch settlement as a way-station for ships. 
                        This led to the importation of enslaved people from Indonesia and Madagascar. 
                        Great Britain took control in 1806 and later abolished slavery in 1833.
                        Cape Town became a legislative capital in 1910 with a increase in growth and infrastructure development.
                        During Apartheid forced removals had a devastating impact on communities like those in District Six. 
                        Cape Town was home to a vast majority of anti-apartheid leaders, 
                        with Nelson Mandela addressing the public from the City Hall balcony after his release from imprisonment. 
                        Since 1994, the city has evolved into a key economic and tourist destination.</p>
